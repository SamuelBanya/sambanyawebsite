I followed this guide in terms of how to setup Postgres for this project:
- https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database

I then used this command to install the Postgres dependencies:
npm i @vercel/postgres

I deployed a new PostgresSQL database, and then then went to Quick Start > .env.local tab within the Vercel site itself.

I then copied the related .env.local information into the project's local '.env.local' file itself.

I then modified the 'package.json' file to look like this:
```
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build",
  "dev": "next dev",
  "start": "next start",
  "seed": "node -r dotenv/config ./scripts/seed.js"
},
```

I then ran this command:
```
npm run seed
```

NOTE:
I had to use this page to figure out how to use 'index.d.ts' file to import 'next-auth' properly:

NOTE:
- I can use this as an example for my art gallery website:
